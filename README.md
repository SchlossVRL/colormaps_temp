# The role of spatial organization for interpreting colormap data visualizations

This repo consists of the MATLAB code to generate the image dataset used in the experiments conducted for this research study.
- ```main.m``` creates the images dataset for the experiments in separate folders.
- ```generate_datasets.m``` generates the underlying data used to create images.
- ```generate_colormaps.m``` is the MATLAB script for generating the images using the data from ```generate_datasets.m```
- ```IMAGES``` folder containing the image dataset for all the experiments.
To create the image dataset for the experiments, simply execute the ```main.m``` file
